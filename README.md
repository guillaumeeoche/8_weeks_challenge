# 8 Weeks SQL Challenge by [Danny Ma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/).

The 8 Week SQL Challenge consists to solve 8 use cases in different kinds of fields.   

In this repository, you can find all my work on #8WEEKSQLCHALLENGE given by DANNY MA. One folder by Challenge. 

In each folder, you have a .md to explain what I'm doing and a .sql with all the queries.
